# cadre-tea-router= cadre-tea-router
:toc:

TEA-specialised routing integration for ReScript, built on top of `cadre-router`.

== Scope

This repository provides TEA/Elm-Architecture wiring:
* Route -> Msg patterns
* init-from-URL helpers
* subscriptions for URL changes
* Cmd helpers for navigation (push/replace/back/forward)
* TEA-focused examples

== Non-goals

* Re-implementing URL parsing/formatting combinators (belongs to `cadre-router`).
* Framework-agnostic routing primitives (belongs to `cadre-router`).
* React-specific routing APIs unless they are explicitly TEA-driven.

== Dependency

This package depends on `cadre-router` as the stable core.
